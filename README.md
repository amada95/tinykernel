# tinykernel

### about
a simple kernel/"operating system" I'm writing to help me learn more about operating systems, gnu, c, and x86 assembly

## updates section
as of 1/18/22, I have finished the basic VGA color display driver and configured an automated iso build using `grub` and `qemu`!

feast your eyes >:D

### try it yourself
instructions coming soontm!

### plans for the future
  1. Keyboard driver
  2. Simple shell
  3. Basic filesystem
  4. Better build system (perhaps `CMake` or the like)
  5. Core programs (e.g. text editor)
  6. GUI Experiments
  7. Simple games (e.g. snake, tic-tac-toe, etc.)
  8. Rapid deployment and testing with `docker`

NOTE: these are only ideas sorted loosely in the order I hope to complete them, and may or may not be implemented.
